              <h2>As you were probably told when you were in elementary school, “Just be yourself.” </h2>

               <p> You can be a much happier person once you figure out who you truly are and when you learn how to be yourself. 
                If you are like most people, then you have probably told yourself that things would be better if there were certain changes in your life or changes to yourself. 
                You can make those positive changes yourself. Be proactive, and have a more positive outlook about yourself </p>

                    Don’t Aim to Please Others
                    There is a problem if you are never doing what you want to do, yet always doing what everyone else wants to do. This Is Why You Shouldn’t Please Others But Yourself.
                    Pleasing others can be a nice thing to do, but know where your boundaries are. Instead of always aiming to please others, you should do things for yourself as well every now and then.
                     </li> 
                <li>Don’t Worry About How Others View You
                    Occasionally thinking about how others view you may make you change for the good, but you should not be constantly wondering about what others are thinking. You should change if you want to, and change into what or who you want to change into.
                  </li>
                <li> Learn More About Yourself
                    Do you know who you really are? Ever since you were young, you have been conditioned to be one way or another. It may be weird just to spend a day being your spontaneous self, but sometimes it is the only way that you can learn how to be yourself.
                    </li>
                <li> Appreciate Who You Are
                    No matter how weird you are, appreciate yourself! Each person is unique, and everyone has at least a little weirdness in themselves. Appreciate your weirdness and let it out.
                    </li>
                <li> Be Confident with Who You Are
                    Do you ever doubt yourself? Doubting yourself can be very easy if you are constantly comparing yourself to others and wondering “What if?”
                    Instead of doubting yourself all the time, you should be confident with yourself and who you are. Showing confidence in yourself and your decisions will also show to others that you know what you are doing.
                    </li>
                <li> Forgive Yourself
                    Forgive yourself for thinking negatively. Forgive yourself for talking, without thinking twice. Forgive yourself for being rude to your superiors, your friends, your parents, or your siblings.
                    Don’t think negative thoughts about yourself for taking wrong steps or making wrong decisions. This kind of thinking puts your focus on the problem and not the solution. It’s better to say good things about yourself than to say negative things. Always saying positive things about yourself is a sign that you have forgiven yourself.

                    </li>
                <li> Find a Hobby That You Love
